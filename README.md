Sometimes, while making tasty computer programs, one needs a place to
store labeled containers of data. Spicerack is that kind of place.

This library is a Clojure wrapper for [MapDB](http://www.mapdb.org) —
a fast, disk-persistent data-structures library. Like many Clojure
wrappers around Java libraries, this one is incomplete. MapDB supports
several data structures (`Map`, `Set` and `List`, implemented with
trees and hashes), and can do fun things with them, like creating a
hash table that acts as a cache with automatic eviction and change
listeners. This wrapper doesn't support any of that. It just provides
an idiomatic way to store something like a Clojure `hash-map` on disk.

I plan to add the other data types over time, as I need them for my
own projects. In the meantime, these bits are well-tested and already
very useful.

## Usage 

``` clojure
[spicerack "0.1.3"]
```

There are only a handful of functions in this wrapper. It provides
`open-database` and `close` (though it's best to use clojure's
`with-open` macro to handle closing), `put!`, `remove!`, and
`update!`.  Getting is done with `clojure.core`'s `get` function.

``` clojure
(require '[spicerack.core :refer [open-database open-hashmap put! update!]])

(with-open [db (open-database "./baking-db")]
  (let [ingredients (open-hashmap db "ingredient-hashmap")]
    (put! ingredients :apple-pie [:flour :butter :sugar :apples])
    ;;=> [:flour :butter :sugar :apples]
    (update! ingredients :apple-pie conj :cinnamon)))
    ;;=> [:flour :butter :sugar :apples :cinnamon]
```

There are more examples in the test suite. In additon, there is
